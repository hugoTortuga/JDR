### In development

# JDR - Dungeon Master's Assistant
JDR (short for "Jeu de RÃ´le" in French, meaning "Role-Playing Game") is a comprehensive C# software designed to assist dungeon masters in creating and 
managing tabletop role-playing games, such as Dungeons & Dragons.

## Key features
- Opening a scene (background image and obstacles), with a dynamic lightening

## Architecture
I'm using the ports and adapters architecture, which allows me to easely create my unit tests
and uncouple my logic from my dependencies
