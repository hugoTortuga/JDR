### In development

# JDR - Dungeon Master's Assistant
JDR (short for "Jeu de RÃ´le" in French, meaning "Role-Playing Game") is a comprehensive C# software designed to assist dungeon masters in creating and 
managing tabletop role-playing games, such as Dungeons & Dragons.

## Key features
- Opening a scene (background image and obstacles), with a dynamic lightening

## Architecture
I'm using the ports and adapters architecture, which allows me to easely create my unit tests
and uncouple my logic from my dependencies

### Version NaN
Not playable, so there is no version yet

### TODO
- Precise my ef session usage (not sure yet)
- Continue in the db + mapping
- Ctrl z implementation to come back on the save
- Ctrl s to save the game creation
- Make the interface beautiful and user friendly
